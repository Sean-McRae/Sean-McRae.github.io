# About Sean McRae

I'm a Senior Principal Security Engineer with over a decade of experience in offensive security and vulnerability research. My work focuses on application security assessments, developing scalable testing methodologies, and discovering novel attacks!

This blog serves as a platform for publishing security research, vulnerability findings, and practical insights from real-world penetration testing engagements. I write about the attack vectors I discover, the methodologies I develop, and research I find interesting.
